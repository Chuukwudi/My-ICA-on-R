# My-ICA-on-R

Using data from the 2018 Stackoverflow Development Survey, IÂ  performed Exploratory Data Analysis to gain insights on what factors affect choices like desired operating system, frameworks, platforms, software development methodologies, programming languages, Vision control of choice, Integrated Development Environments and preferred Database worked with.


In the end, using these factors mentioned above as features, I applied machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and Naive Bayes to predict what type of operating system a developer is likely to use while using cross-validation to optimise my results.
