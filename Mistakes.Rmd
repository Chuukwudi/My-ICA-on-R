I was using filter to remove na column by column until I discovered na.omit

I chose Hobby before but removed it as it made my dataset too small including it would make me choose only those who answered No. which would reduce my data to 2396 instead of 2396(No) + 12649(Yes)
##### Do you code as a hobby?
```{r}
 print(summary(dataset$Hobby))
```


#### **Hobby:**:

##### Do you code as a hobby?
```{r}
 print(summary(dataset$Hobby))
```
I would like to focus on those who are serious with programming and not just hobbyists.

```{r}
dataset <- filter(dataset, Hobby == "No") 
#Select only those who are seriously into programming.

print(summary(dataset$Hobby))  
# Let us check if we have eliminated the Yeses.

#We do not the Hobby column anymore. let us remove it.
dataset <- subset(dataset, select = -c(Hobby))

print(str(dataset))
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
```{r}

variables <- list()
for(rows in dataset$LanguageWorkedWith){
 lii <- strsplit(rows, ";")[[1]]
 for(item in lii){
  if (!(item %in% variables)){
   variables <-append(variables, item)
  }
  }
 
}

fish.out <- function(column, ...){
 
 for(i in list(...)) {
        dataset[i] <- ifelse(grepl( toString(i), column, fixed = TRUE), "Yes", "No")
    }
 return(dataset)
}



print(unlist(variables))
atw <- fish.out(dataset$LanguageWorkedWith, "C#", "JavaScript", "SQL", "HTML", 
                "CSS", "Python", "Bash/Shell", "PHP", "C", "C++", "Java", "VB.NET", 
                "TypeScript", "VBA", "Swift", "Assembly", "Objective-C", 
                "Visual Basic 6", "F#", "Scala", "Ruby", "R", "Groovy", "Rust",
                "Kotlin", "Lua", "Delphi/Object Pascal", "Matlab", "Erlang", 
                "Haskell", "Julia", "Clojure", "Ocaml", "Cobol", "Hack")

View(atw$Java, atw$JavaScript)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
